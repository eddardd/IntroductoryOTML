# Crash-Course in Deep Learning using Tensorflow

The resources for this course are in Portuguese. I covered the following topics:

* Machine Learning fundamentals (mathematical notation, calculus, algebra, datasets),
* Single Layer Perceptron
  * Biological Motivation
  * Mathematical Model
  * Training Algorithm (cost functions, gradient descent and chain rule)
* Multi-layer Perceptron
  * Chain Rule, Backpropagation Algorithm and Automatic Differentiation
* Concepts behind Tensorflow
  * Why Tensorflow?
  * Tensorflow layers, models, optimizers, compilation and the fit method
* Convolutional Neural Networks
  * Limitations of densely connected networks
  * Convolution and Pooling operations
  * Why use convolutions?
  * Intuition behind Representation Learning
* Selected Topics
  * Transfer Learning
  * Who has the deeper neural net?
  * Model deployment


This corresponds to 2 hours of presentation. Another 2 hours were devoted to practical aspects of Tensorflow, which
are available in PracticalWork1.ipynb and PracticalWork2.ipynb. The Talk is freely available on Youtube: [[Day 1]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdJqcvWEO1U) and [[Day 2]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQoGrAquaTs).
